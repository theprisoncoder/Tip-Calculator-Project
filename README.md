# Tip-Calculator-Project
This is App Project 1 through the Justice Through Code Bootcamp.

OVERVIEW

This is an individual project. I have been tasked with creating a command line app in python app and put a GitHub repo for it. 

DETAILS

The requirements for this project are as follows:

The Tip Calculator
Make a python script tip_calculator.py that takes a user's input at the command line for:

Cost of the food
Number of people splitting the bill
Percentage of the tip

Then, the script should output:

The total bill (including tip)
How much each person should pay (you can assume all people will split the bill evenly)
Assume there is a 10% sales tax. Add this into the total bill (although this shouldn't be included in calculating the tip itself)!

Note: The tip calculator should be able to handle a bill of any amount of many money, with any number of people splitting the bill, and with any tip percentage (including 0 tip)

Cases the app should be able to handle:
A meal for 1
